    #What actions should we take when a player receives a warning?
    #Format is like:
    #<number of warnings>: 'commands to execute;seperated by semicolons'
    #Examples:
    #actions:
    #   1: 'msg {name} You have been warned!'
    #   2: 'strike {name};msg {name} You have angered Zeus!'
    #   3: 'tempban {name} 1 hour Reached Max Warnings. Reasons:\n{reasons}\nBy: {banner}'
    #Variables allowed:
    #{name} the name of the player
    #{ip} the last known IP of the player
    #{reason} the last reason the player was warned
    #{reasons} all the reasons (seperated by new lines) for this punishment. Example:
    #Reason1: "Griefing"
    #Reason2: "Spamming"
    #Reason3: "Begging for items"
    #Now, if I did
    #3: 'tempban {name} 1 hour Reached Max Warnings:\n{reasons}'
    #it would disconnect the user with this message:
    #-------------------------------------
    #You have been Temporarily Banned for:
    #'Reached Max Warnings:
    #Griefing
    #Spamming
    #Begging for items'
    #By Console. Expires in 1 hour
    #-------------------------------------
    #If the command starts with a /, then the banner will execute the command
    #Otherwise, the command will be executed by CONSOLE.
    #You might want to use -s in these commands (To stop them broadcasting messages to players)
    actions:
        2: '/kick {name} Final Warning: \n{reason}'
        3: '/tempban {name} 1 hour Reached Max Warnings:\n{reasons}'
    #After receiving this many warnings, they will be all deleted.
    #If 'actions' has an action for a number higher than this, then the action will never be
    #done... Because this resets it to 0
    #If you set this to <= 0, then it will be ignored, and warnings will never reset.
